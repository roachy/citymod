# Metatables

In order to simplify calls to the libraries, functions are created on metatables that drastically eases how to perform actions on for example a player. As a demonstration, "CityMod.Player:GiveItem()" could be simplified to "MyPlayer:GiveItem()", where the latter would call the library function.
